### Neat stuff you can do with Android:

    You can find Apps in the Google Play store while on a Windows machine, then install them on any of your Android devices. Kinda handy if you don't have access to the device, but want to have the app on it when you do go to it.
    You can very often Root and/or hack Android devices with custom ROMs.
