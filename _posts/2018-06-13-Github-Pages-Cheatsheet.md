### Editing Notes
1. Make sure the title is the correct format:
    * YYYY-MM-DD-Some-Descriptive-Title.md

2. [Optional] Header
   <pre>
   Headers aren't necessary unless you want to specify some non-explicit categories!
   You can just as easily add a note in the test of the post. Search is really a full-text search.
   This is here only for reference. It is not recommended to use headers on this site...
   
   categories: ['MP3','OGG']
   layout: post
   title: Audio Files Cheatsheet
   published: true
   
   Please note that the above lines needs three '-' before and after. There seems to be no way to remark them out!
   
   </pre>

3. Converting HTML source to Markdown:

4. Markdown
